A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better.

    "# Abstract \n",
    "For our project, we aim to develop a simulation of the tumor microenvironment using a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and Monte Carlo simulation to model the immune system's response to cancer with various treatment strategies. The data being used in our project represents biological factors like T-cell activity, macrophages, and more to analyze the effectiveness of different types of immunotherapies. We will be doing a reinforcement learning model to learn and optimize treatment strategies to identify the best actions for reducing cancer cells while minimizing damage to the immune system. Success will be measured by the percentage of simulations that are able to successfully reach the desired goal state as that will indicate the effective tumor suppression while also maintaining the immune system together.

    "# Background\n",
    "In our study, we plan to create a simulation of a tumor microenvironment, where we aim to analyze the immune system’s response to cancer as well as potential therapies and drug treatments. First we must define what a tumor microenvironment is. As defined by the National Cancer Institute (NIH), they define a tumor microenvironment as “The normal cells, molecules, and blood vessels that surround and feed a tumor cell. A tumor can change its microenvironment, and the microenvironment can affect how a tumor grows and spreads” [<sup>[1]</sup>](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/tumor-microenvironment).\n",
    "\n",
    "So now we have to ask how we can model the tumor microenvironment? The article “Modelling the Tumour Microenvironment, but What Exactly Do We Mean by Model” answers this question. According to the author Reyes-Aldasoro, “Stochastic models of tumor microenvironments are more common than deterministic ones by an approximate ratio of 10 to 1, which is probably a reflection of the many factors related to cancer, like somatic evolution, which are not deterministic.” [<sup>[2]</sup>](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10416922/). Keeping this in mind we can take an MDP approach in modeling our tumor microenvironment as our state transitions are based on probabilities. Now to define our states, we refer back to the same article where they conducted a query to see the frequency of appearances of keywords associated with microenvironments, in order to determine which parameters may be necessary to keep in mind [<sup>[2]</sup>](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10416922/). Based on Figure 3 of this article and keeping in mind our limitations for this project, we have identified T cells, Cytokines, and Proliferation as key parameters to keep in mind when designing this model. Now to determine state transitions, the article discusses a series of mathematical models most notably the Malthusian Growth Model and Armitage and Doll Model which can be used to define our state transitions, particularly for cancer cell levels [<sup>[2]</sup>](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10416922/).\n",
    "\n",
    "When modeling the tumor microenvironment, we have defined T-cells as a key parameter in how we will approach our states, state transitions, and action space. According to the article “Role of T cells in cancer immunotherapy: Opportunities and challenges”, they state how T-cell therapy, particularly chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy (CAR-T), can be very effective in eliminating cancer cells, however it can also potentially compromise the immune system [<sup>[3]</sup>](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10846312/). Therefore there needs to be a balance between T-cell therapy destroying cancer cells and not compromising the immune system. Pertaining to our action space, we can include T-cell therapy as an action where it will increase the number of T-cells and decrease the cancer levels. However, we can incorporate some probability of it compromising the immune system in our MDP implementation. Additionally, cytokines play an important role in this tumor microenvironment model, as we can use it to determine the state of the immune system. For example, when utilizing CAR-T therapy, it can cause a large release of cytokines, which leads to a severe reaction of the immune system. Additionally, when cytokine levels are low, it means the immune system is unresponsive, as a result, the tumor will continue to grow. In the article “Current Status of IL-10 and Regulatory T-cells in Cancer”, the article largely discusses the role of the IL-10 gene which is a type of cytokine. Their findings were that even though it was previously known that IL-10 was inhibiting T-cell activity, it can actually enhance T-cell activity when paired with genes such as IL-2 which is known to increase T-cell activity [<sup>[4]</sup>](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4322764/). What this means is that IL-10 on its own would lead to uncontrollable tumor growth, whereas IL-10 accompanied by IL-2 will lead to tumor suppression. What this ultimately means is that tracking IL-2 and IL-10 in our microenvironment simulation will be necessary for determining the state of the tumor in addition to T-cell levels in the microenvironment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bringing all of these concepts together, we can effectively generate a tumor microenvironment simulation utilizing MDP and Monte Carlo simulations in order to determine the best course of action to destroy a cancer cell while keeping the immune system intact. With the knowledge that tumor microenvironments are stochastic rather than deterministic, we have the understanding that there may not be a definitive course of action that will lead to our goal state. This is where the Monte Carlo methods will come in. By running the simulations hundreds if not thousands of times, we can average out each episode and see which course of action will give us the highest probability of a good outcome.\n",

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Cancer treatments are known to be complex and complicated due to interactions between tumor cells and immune cells. Newly developed immunotherapy treatments like CAR-T cell therapy have been effective but also have had side effects such as overactivation or suppression of the immune system. This is where the challenge lies in identifying the best strategies of treatment that would efficiently suppress tumor growth without affecting the immune state. We aim to address this issue by developing a simulation model of the tumor microenvironment by using a Markov Decision Process and Monte Carlo simulation. Our model will incorporate T-cell activity, cytokine interactions, and proliferation dynamics in an attempt to explore the probabilistic progression of cancer growth and treatment outcome. Based on the use of clinical and genomic information, our goal is to create an AI system that learns and provides the best immunotherapy regimen recommendations through reinforcement learning. Our model's problem is expressed through a state space, action space, transition probabilities, and reward function. The tumor microenvironment is represented by key variables such as cancer cell levels, T-cell counts, and cytokine concentrations, while treatment actions, including CAR-T cell therapy and cytokine modulation, influence state transitions based on real-world clinical data. Transition probabilities capture the likelihood of moving between states, and a reward function is designed to optimize tumor reduction while maintaining immune stability. We will be measuring tumor cell reduction, cumulative reward, and success rate. Our problem is replicable as our model will be trained on publicly available clinical datasets so that it can be reproduced by other people. "

    "1. Modeling the Tumor Environment: We will model the tumor environment as a Markov Decision Process where the states represent the levels of cancer cells, T-cells, and cytokines. The actions in the decision process will include therapies such as CAR-T cell therapy and cytokine modulation.

Feature Selection and Model Training: We will perform feature selection to identify the most relevant that influence the outcome which will allow us to reduce the complexity of our model and improve the generalization. We will also explore a bunch of hyperparameters to optimize the performance of the RL agent. We will try to focus on a few hyperparameters given the computational complexity. \n",

Additionally, the benchmark model will also help and offer improvements to our adaptive approach. The solution is applicable because it directly addresses the stochastic and complex nature of tumor microenvironments, which cannot be effectively modeled using deterministic approaches.
